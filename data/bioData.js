    bio:'My name is Jeressia Williamson and I am a software engineer currently living in Nashville, TN. I have been in love with technology for as long as I can remember, but I have only worked in this industry for 2 years. In my spare time, I am a creative. I like to do anything that involves making something: I code, I paint, I build furniture, and I’m heavily interested in interior and graphic design. I have 2 dogs, Java & Jumanji, that help keep me active. As a former mental health social worker, this app means a lot to me. Mental health (especially in the black community) is often neglected and dismissed. I love that SafeSpace is an outlet for black women to be vulnerable and reveal workplace stressors without judgment. An app like ours is so important in a world where we are not allowed to be vocal about negative experiences without being labeled “angry black women.'

    bio:'My name is Jeressia Williamson and I am a software engineer currently living in Nashville, TN. I have been in love with technology for as long as I can remember, but I have only worked in this industry for 2 years. In my spare time, I am a creative. I like to do anything that involves making something: I code, I paint, I build furniture, and I’m heavily interested in interior and graphic design. I have 2 dogs, Java & Jumanji, that help keep me active. As a former mental health social worker, this app means a lot to me. Mental health (especially in the black community) is often neglected and dismissed. I love that SafeSpace is an outlet for black women to be vulnerable and reveal workplace stressors without judgment. An app like ours is so important in a world where we are not allowed to be vocal about negative experiences without being labeled “angry black women.'

    bio:'Hi, I’m Jameka, a software developer and mobile engineer. I’ve been in the tech industry for a little over 4 years. I also help teach during the evening at Nashville Software School where I’m able to connect with future developers and assist them the way I would have wanted to be guided during my early days. For fun I love to read, go to new restaurants, travel with my family and friends, visit museums and go to the theater. When I’m not doing that, I lounge with my dog, Linq and vibe out. Being able to help create this app feels good. As a black woman myself, I have found how hard and how frequent it is for black women to internalize trauma caused by work related situations and having no outlet. This app is here to help those who identify as black women, journal their issues and find meaningful ways to resolve the issue and heal. The entire goal is to effectively bring the issue up, resolve it and heal from it all of which makes me feel extremely excited to be a part of it.'

    bio:'I am Dr. Teresa Vasquez, but you can call me Dr. T. If I could go back in time and talk with that little girl in the picture, I would tell her that although she had already experienced immense loss at her young age, there was much more loss to come from an industry that she would grow to love and that SHE would become a change agent after 20+ years in tech. She, as a tech leader, would own her trauma and demand healing for herself and other Black women like her. That she would accomplish so much more than she ever dreamed because beauty comes from ashes and she would create SafeSpace. with a group of like-minded Black engineers so that all Black women could embody their full potential and dreams along their way to healing.

    bio:'I have always been a creative person since I was young. I would draw, write, and create unique things such as poetry, models and designs. I loved video games and anything tech related intrigued me. Aside from my creative abilities and tech interests, I knew I wanted to service disadvantaged communities. I had a curiosity about different healthcare resources for all regardless of their race, access or income. With a background in public health and now the pursuit of a new career path as a software developer, I was excited to learn I could bring all of my interests together to make an application specifically for Black women’s mental health and the expression of their experiences within the workplace. I love the fact that our application, Safespace. welcomes discussion and journaling of workplace taboo topics. I was extremely proud to come together with fellow black female software developers to create a place where women like us can be vulnerable, vocal, and acknowledged. I believe our goal to construct an application that provides women like me with resources and dialogue that can be used to achieve mental health stability and personal growth was accomplished!

    bio:'My name is Jeressia Williamson and I am a software engineer currently living in Nashville, TN. I have been in love with technology for as long as I can remember, but I have only worked in this industry for 2 years. In my spare time, I am a creative. I like to do anything that involves making something: I code, I paint, I build furniture, and I’m heavily interested in interior and graphic design. I have 2 dogs, Java & Jumanji, that help keep me active. As a former mental health social worker, this app means a lot to me. Mental health (especially in the black community) is often neglected and dismissed. I love that SafeSpace is an outlet for black women to be vulnerable and reveal workplace stressors without judgment. An app like ours is so important in a world where we are not allowed to be vocal about negative experiences without being labeled “angry black women.',

    bio:'Hi, I’m Jameka, a software developer and mobile engineer. I’ve been in the tech industry for a little over 4 years. I also help teach during the evening at Nashville Software School where I’m able to connect with future developers and assist them the way I would have wanted to be guuserIded during my early days. For fun I love to read, go to new restaurants, travel with my family and friends, visit museums and go to the theater. When I’m not doing that, I lounge with my dog, Linq and vibe out. Being able to help create this app feels good. As a black woman myself, I have found how hard and how frequent it is for black women to internalize trauma caused by work related situations and having no outlet. This app is here to help those who userIdentify as black women, journal their issues and find meaningful ways to resolve the issue and heal. The entire goal is to effectively bring the issue up, resolve it and heal from it all of which makes me feel extremely excited to be a part of it.',

    bio:'For as long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to express myself creatively. As a child, and even in my adult life, I find myself drawing, writing, and creating unique models and designs. I have a love for video games and all things tech related. Aside from my creative abilities and tech interests, I have a heart to serve underrepresented communities. Growing up in Chicago’s Southside, I’ve seen first hand the result of limited resources and a lack of focus on physical and mental health. Safespace. has allowed me an opportunity to align my background in Public Health with my newly established journey in software development to aid in the creation of a platform welcoming women to discuss and journal workplace taboo topics. It has been a privilege collaborating with fellow black female software developers to create a mechanism where women like us can be vulnerable, vocal, and supported. It has been a goal of mine to help bridge the gap of resources and create dialogue surrounding mental health stability, and I believe Safespace. does exactly that!',

        Each of us is capable of using all five conflict-handling modes. None of
        us can be characterized as having a single style of dealing with
        conflict. But certain people use some modes better than others and,
        therefore, tend to rely on those modes more heavily than othersâ€”whether
        because of temperament or practice.

        Your conflict behavior in the workplace is therefore a result of both
        your personal predispositions and the requirements of the situation in
        which you find yourself. Knowing what your default style is will help
        you understand your response and know when you should choose another
        style when needed.
